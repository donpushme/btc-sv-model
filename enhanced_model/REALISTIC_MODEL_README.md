# Realistic Enhanced Model for Cryptocurrency Prediction

## Overview

This is a **professional and realistic enhanced model** specifically designed for cryptocurrency price prediction with emphasis on capturing real-world market patterns. The model addresses the limitations of the previous "enhanced model" by incorporating time-of-day variations, market microstructure features, and realistic constraints that make predictions more aligned with actual market behavior.
