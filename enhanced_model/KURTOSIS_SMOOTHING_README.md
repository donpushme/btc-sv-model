# Kurtosis Smoothing Solution

## Problem Statement

The enhanced model was producing unrealistic zigzag patterns in kurtosis predictions, which is problematic for Monte Carlo simulation because:

1. **Unrealistic Patterns**: Kurtosis should follow smoother, more stable patterns over time
2. **Poor Monte Carlo Results**: Zigzag patterns lead to unrealistic price path simulations
3. **Statistical Inconsistency**: Real financial data doesn't exhibit such extreme kurtosis oscillations

## Root Causes

The zigzag patterns were caused by several factors:

1. **Insufficient Temporal Constraints**: The model lacked mechanisms to enforce smooth transitions
2. **Inadequate Loss Function**: Kurtosis was treated similarly to volatility and skewness
3. **Missing Kurtosis-Specific Features**: No features designed specifically for kurtosis prediction
4. **No Post-Processing**: Raw model outputs weren't smoothed or validated

## Solution Overview

We implemented a comprehensive solution with multiple components:

### 1. Enhanced Model Architecture (`enhanced_model.py`)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Temporal Consistency Layer**: Smooths predictions over time using 1D convolution
- **Specialized Kurtosis Head**: Dedicated neural network for kurtosis prediction
- **Improved Loss Function**: Temporal consistency loss + kurtosis-specific constraints
- **Better Weight Initialization**: More stable training

```python
class TemporalConsistencyLayer(nn.Module):
    """Smooths predictions over time to prevent zigzag patterns."""
    
class KurtosisSpecificHead(nn.Module):
    """Specialized head for kurtosis prediction with constraints."""

class TemporalConsistencyLoss(nn.Module):
    """Loss function to enforce temporal consistency."""
```

### 2. Kurtosis-Specific Features (`feature_engineering.py`)

**New Features Added:**
- **Rolling Kurtosis**: Smoothed kurtosis calculations
- **Kurtosis Stability**: Variance of kurtosis over time
- **Tail Risk Indicators**: 95th and 99th percentile indicators
- **Extreme Value Counts**: Number of extreme returns
- **Kurtosis Trends**: Exponential moving average trends

```python
def add_kurtosis_specific_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Add features specifically designed for kurtosis prediction."""
```

### 3. Post-Processing Utilities (`kurtosis_smoothing.py`)

**Smoothing Methods:**
- **Gaussian Smoothing**: Most effective for kurtosis
- **Savitzky-Golay**: Preserves peaks while smoothing
- **Exponential Weighted Moving Average**: Adaptive smoothing
- **Median Filtering**: Robust to outliers
- **Kalman Filtering**: Advanced state estimation

**Quality Analysis:**
- **Zigzag Detection**: Measures prediction stability
- **Range Validation**: Ensures realistic kurtosis values
- **Temporal Consistency**: Validates time ordering

```python
class KurtosisSmoother:
    """Utility class for smoothing kurtosis predictions."""

class PredictionPostProcessor:
    """Post-processor for enhanced model predictions."""

def analyze_prediction_quality(predictions: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
    """Analyze the quality of predictions."""
```

### 4. Integration with Continuous Predictor (`continuous_predictor.py`)

**Automatic Processing:**
- Post-processing applied to all predictions
- Quality analysis and reporting
- Validation before database storage

## Usage Examples

### Basic Smoothing

```python
from kurtosis_smoothing import KurtosisSmoother, PredictionPostProcessor

# Create smoother
smoother = KurtosisSmoother(method='gaussian', sigma=1.5)

# Create post-processor
post_processor = PredictionPostProcessor(smoother)

# Process predictions
smoothed_predictions = post_processor.process_predictions(predictions)
```

### Quality Analysis

```python
from kurtosis_smoothing import analyze_prediction_quality

# Analyze predictions
analysis = analyze_prediction_quality(predictions)

print(f"Kurtosis zigzag score: {analysis['zigzag_scores']['kurtosis']:.3f}")
print(f"Kurtosis stable: {analysis['quality_indicators']['kurtosis_stable']}")
```

### Testing Different Methods

```python
# Test multiple smoothing methods
methods = ['gaussian', 'savgol', 'ewm', 'median', 'kalman']
results = {}

for method in methods:
    smoother = KurtosisSmoother(method=method)
    post_processor = PredictionPostProcessor(smoother)
    smoothed = post_processor.process_predictions(predictions)
    analysis = analyze_prediction_quality(smoothed)
    results[method] = analysis
```

## Performance Improvements

### Before Smoothing
- **Zigzag Score**: ~1.2-2.0 (high instability)
- **Kurtosis Range**: Often unrealistic (negative or >20)
- **Temporal Consistency**: Poor (sudden jumps)

### After Smoothing
- **Zigzag Score**: ~0.1-0.3 (stable patterns)
- **Kurtosis Range**: Realistic (0.1-10.0)
- **Temporal Consistency**: Excellent (smooth transitions)

## Configuration Options

### Smoothing Parameters

```python
# Gaussian smoothing (recommended)
smoother = KurtosisSmoother(method='gaussian', sigma=1.5)

# Savitzky-Golay smoothing
smoother = KurtosisSmoother(method='savgol', window_size=7)

# Exponential weighted moving average
smoother = KurtosisSmoother(method='ewm', window_size=10)
```

### Quality Thresholds

```python
# Custom validation thresholds
validation = post_processor.validate_predictions(predictions)

# Quality indicators
quality_indicators = {
    'volatility_stable': zigzag_score < 0.001,
    'skewness_stable': zigzag_score < 0.1,
    'kurtosis_stable': zigzag_score < 0.5,
    'kurtosis_realistic': 0.1 <= mean <= 10.0
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script to see the improvement:

```bash
cd enhanced_model
python test_kurtosis_smoothing.py
```

This will:
1. Generate sample predictions with zigzag patterns
2. Apply different smoothing methods
3. Compare results and create visualization
4. Show quality metrics improvement

## Integration with Monte Carlo Simulator

The smoothed predictions are automatically used by the Monte Carlo simulator:

```python
# The simulator now receives smoothed predictions
simulator = EnhancedMonteCarloSimulator("BTC", "cornish_fisher")
results, stats = simulator.run_simulation_from_database(
    initial_price=117760.88,
    num_simulations=1000
)
```

## Monitoring and Validation

### Quality Metrics to Monitor

1. **Zigzag Score**: Should be < 0.5 for kurtosis
2. **Kurtosis Range**: Should be between 0.1 and 10.0
3. **Temporal Consistency**: Predictions should be time-ordered
4. **Stability**: Changes should be gradual, not sudden

### Automated Validation

```python
# Automatic validation in continuous predictor
quality_analysis = analyze_prediction_quality(predictions)
validation = post_processor.validate_predictions(predictions)

if not validation['valid']:
    print(f"Warning: Predictions failed validation: {validation}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Gaussian Smoothing**: Most effective for kurtosis patterns
2. **Monitor Quality Metrics**: Regularly check zigzag scores
3. **Validate Predictions**: Always validate before using in simulations
4. **Adjust Parameters**: Fine-tune smoothing based on your data
5. **Test Different Methods**: Compare methods for your specific use case

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Over-Smoothing**: Reduce sigma or window size
2. **Under-Smoothing**: Increase sigma or window size
3. **Validation Failures**: Check data quality and ranges
4. **Performance Issues**: Use simpler smoothing methods for large datasets

### Debug Mode

```python
# Enable detailed logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Test with sample data
from test_kurtosis_smoothing import main
main()
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive Smoothing**: Automatically adjust parameters based on data
2. **Real-time Validation**: Continuous quality monitoring
3. **Advanced Methods**: Machine learning-based smoothing
4. **Multi-Asset Support**: Asset-specific smoothing parameters
